* Set up your mining ship and booster ship.

# Asteroid Monitor

A tool to make mining more enjoyable. It's able to:

* notify you of asteroid expiration before the laser cycle ends
* alert you when your ore hold is filled
* provide you with various timers for your needs
* all of this - per-window. Turn your mining operation with six alts into whack-an-asteroid game with nearly zero mining time loss!

To correctly use the monitor, you need to:

* use Windows OS. There's no monitor for other OSes at this moment.
* set up API keys for all your chars. Monitor will ignore unknown chars.
* set up API key for your booster. If the key isn't available, you should set up booster skills on the custom character and use it as a booster.
* correctly set ship equipment for all your miners and a booster
* check, that calculated values for mining yield, mining cycle time and ore hold are correct
* set up monitor settings and asteroid filter as needed
* load survey scanner result (ctr-a, then ctrl-c in the results window, ctrl-v into the Load Scan window)
* check, that used ore hold is same both in monitor and a game, adjust if needed
* start mining ingame, and then in the monitor, same turret on the same asteroid. You can press interface buttons for that, or use f1-f3 buttons, same as ingame
* respond to the alerts
* rince and repeat
